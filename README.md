Welcome to Schema.org Python AppEngine  -  sdopythonapp
=======================================================


This is the repository that contains the Python based AppEngine that supports the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) site. 

Originally it was intimately bound with the Schema.org vocabulary and its supporting files.

To remove dependances and to enable its use in supporting other vocabularies it was extracted into its own repository.

Schema.org, and other supported vocabularies, access this functionality by including this repository as a git submodule of their repository.  For more details of Schema.org check out the [schemaorg repository](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg). 

Issues and proposals are managed here by participants of the [W3C Schema.org Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/). If you are interested to participate please
join the group at the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/), introduce yourself and find or file issues here that engage your interest. 

Do not raise issues here for the Schema.org vocabulary itself.

If you are new to Git and GitHub, there's a useful [introduction to Github](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/Github) in the W3C Wiki.


Software
========

For most collaborators, all you need to know about the software is how to run it. Essentially you will need to have the Python version of Google App Engine SDK running on the platform of your choice. You can then make test builds of schema.org running on your own machine accessible as http://localhost:8080/ or else post them on appspot.com for collaboration. See the [Appengine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/) for details.

Note: This software currently runs under Python 2.7

More information about the software is also available in [SOFTWARE_README.md](SOFTWARE_README.md)

Notes
=====

This documentation concerns the software codebase rather than schema.org itself.

However do note that labels, comments, and documentation should use US English, if a choice between English variants is needed. Please aim for international
English wherever possible.
